    <td>
    Python is designed to be easy to understand and fun to use. Fun during learning is a good incentive to continue, and with it you can build models and tools quickly, so many find that coding in Python is great and smooth. Thus, it gained popularity as a beginner-friendly language, and it has replaced Java as the most popular introductory language at the best American universities.Being a very high-level language, Python reads like English, which requires an effort to learn to read and write in English, etc. It is an easy-to-understand language.
As a dynamically written language, Python is a truly flexible language. Which means that there are no strict rules. Moreover, this language is more fault tolerant, that is, you will still be able to translate and run the program until you can find the problem part.</td>
